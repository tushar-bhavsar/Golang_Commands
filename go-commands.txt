All the commands related to Go-Lang will be added here for future reference

#01 To Check the version of the Go : go version

* before creating any project make sure to create three folders
  1-bin
  2-pkg
  3-src

#02 To get repositories from github : go get -d github repositories url

#03 To run the file with .go extension = go run (needs a file name, eg, go run main.go)
                                         go run <file name>
                                         go run *.go (to run all files which has .go extention)

#04 To Build an EXE file of the Go Application = go build (for an executable:builds the file,reports errors, if any
                                                  if there are no errors, it puts an executable into the current folder)
                                                 (for a package:builds the file reports errors, if any throws away binary

#05 To Build an EXE file of the Go Application = go install (for an executable:compiles the program (builds it) names the executable
                                                 mac: the folder name holding the code
                                                 windows: file name puts the executable in workspace / bin $GOPATH / bin
                                                 (for a package:compiles the package (builds it) puts the executable in workspace / pkg
                                                 $GOPATH / pkg makes it an archive file

#06 : Modules

go mod init:- creates a new module, initializing the go.mod file that describes it.
go build, go test:-  and other package-building commands add new dependencies to go.mod as needed.
go list -m :- all prints the current moduleâ€™s dependencies.
go get :- changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency).
go mod :- tidy removes unused dependencies.
